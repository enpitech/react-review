<br />

> **Built by [Enpitech](https://enpitech.dev)** | a comprehensive AI engineering toolkit for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), VS Code Copilot, Cursor, and more. Multi-pass code review, Figma-to-code implementation, and growing. Works in CI and locally. Supports React, Node.js, Python, and any language.

<br />

## What's Inside

This toolkit packages Enpitech's 10+ years of frontend and fullstack expertise into structured AI skills. Each skill gives your agent a **deterministic, repeatable process** — not a vague prompt, but a step-by-step system.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🔬 Code Review
Multi-pass review system: 5–7 sequential passes per language. Bugs → Security → Architecture → Performance → Quality. CI-ready.

### 🎨 Figma → Code
Pixel-perfect implementation from Figma designs via MCP. Auto breakpoints, design tokens, asset export, visual verification.

### 🔄 Two review scopes
`cr-*` reviews PR diffs (CI + local).<br />`cra-*` audits the full codebase (local, includes deps).

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🧠 Auto-detection
Fullstack and general skills detect your language and framework automatically.

### ⚡ CI-ready
Ships with a GitHub Actions workflow. Comment `/cr-react` on a PR → threaded review comments with `/fix` autofix support.

### 🛠 Customizable
All criteria live in plain markdown files. Add passes, change thresholds, adapt to your stack. More skills coming.

<br />

## Example Use Cases

<table>
<tr>
<td>

#### 💬 PR review in CI
A developer opens a PR with React changes. A teammate comments `/cr-react`. Claude runs 7 review passes on the diff and posts a threaded comment with findings. Each finding ends with "reply `/fix`" and the summary ends with "reply `/fix-all`".

</td>
<td>

#### 🔍 Pre-merge local check
Before pushing a Node.js branch, run `/enpitech:cr-node` locally. Get a findings report, then choose: save to file, fix step by step (approve each change), or fix all at once.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

#### 🏗 Full codebase audit
A tech lead assesses a Python project before a refactor. `/enpitech:cra-python` scans every file + system-level checks (dead code, circular imports, config drift) + full dependency audit.

</td>
<td>

#### 🎨 Figma to production code
A designer hands off a Figma section. `/enpitech:figma-to-code` pulls the design via MCP, classifies nodes as assets or UI elements, uses your design tokens, and screenshots every breakpoint until it matches.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

#### 🌐 Fullstack cross-layer review
A PR touches React frontend and Express backend. `/enpitech:cr-fullstack` auto-detects the stack, applies the right passes per layer, and checks cross-layer issues like API mismatches and auth flow gaps.

</td>
<td>

#### 📦 Dependency health check
Before a release, `/enpitech:cr-deps` checks for CVEs, outdated packages, deprecated deps, license issues, unused packages, and lockfile integrity.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Fullstack — Cross-Layer</strong> (Auto-Detect)</summary>

<br />

**Dynamically detects** which languages are in the project and applies the right criteria per layer:

| Detected | Criteria applied |
|:---------|:-----------------|
| React/Next.js | `rules/react.md` |
| Express/Fastify/Koa | `rules/node.md` |
| Django/Flask/FastAPI | `rules/python.md` |
| Vue, Angular, Svelte, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Java, etc. | `rules/general.md` |
| Monorepo | Reads each workspace's config to classify |

**Stack examples:**
- React + Express → React passes on frontend, Node passes on backend
- Vue + Go → General passes on both (auto-adapted)
- React + FastAPI → React passes on frontend, Python passes on backend

**Cross-layer checks** (always applied):
1. API contract validation
2. Shared type drift
3. Environment variable hygiene
4. Authentication flow consistency
5. Error contract matching
6. Data flow security
7. API versioning & deprecation

```
/enpitech:cr-fullstack       # PR diff + cross-layer checks
/enpitech:cra-fullstack      # Full audit per layer + cross-layer + system checks + dep audit
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Figma → Code</strong> — Implementation Skill</summary>

<br />

Converts Figma designs into pixel-perfect, responsive, production-ready code using MCP tools.

| Step | What it does |
|:-----|:-------------|
| 1. Variables | Collects section name, Figma URL, node IDs, route, selector from user |
| 2. Baselines | Pulls mobile/tablet/desktop images via Figma MCP |
| 3. Token mapping | Auto-discovers breakpoints, maps design values to existing DS tokens |
| 4. Asset classification | Classifies each node as ASSET (export as-is) or UI ELEMENT (build with code) |
| 5. Scaffold | Generates responsive code using DS primitives and tokens |
| 6. Visual verification | Screenshots via Playwright MCP, compares to Figma baseline, iterates |

**Requires**: Figma MCP server + Playwright MCP server running.

**Policies**: No invented content/styles. No new breakpoints. No custom sizes outside token scale. Assets used as-is (never recreated with CSS).

```
/enpitech:figma-to-code      # Interactive — asks for Figma URL and section details
```

</details>

## Installation

The skills and rules are structured markdown files. They work natively as a **Claude Code plugin**, but can also be used with **any AI coding assistant** that reads instructions from your repo — including VS Code with GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and others.

### Option A: Claude Code Plugin

**From a marketplace** search for "Enpitech" and install the "AI Tools" plugin. or in claude code, run:

```
/plugins install enpitech
```

**From a local directory:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enpitech/ai-tools.git
claude --plugin-dir ./ai-tools
```

Or add it permanently to your project's `.claude/plugins.json`.

Skills become `/enpitech:cr-react`, `/enpitech:cra-react`, `/enpitech:cr-node`, etc.

> **Note:** Plugins don't install workflow files. Copy the CI workflow manually:
> ```bash
> cp -r ai-tools/.github your-project/
> ```

### Option B: Copy into your project (works with any AI tool)

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/enpitech/ai-tools.git

# Copy into your project
cp -r ai-tools/rules your-project/rules
cp -r ai-tools/skills your-project/skills
cp -r ai-tools/.github your-project/        # CI workflow (optional)
```

Once the files are in your repo, any AI coding assistant can use them:

| Tool | How it picks up the skills |
|:-----|:---------------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Reads `skills/` and `rules/` automatically. Invoke with `/cr-react`, `/cra-node`, etc. |
| **GitHub Copilot (VS Code)** | Reference the rules files as context in chat, or add them to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| **Cursor** | Add rules files to `.cursor/rules/` or reference them in chat context |
| **Windsurf** | Reference the criteria markdown files as project context |
| **Other AI assistants** | Point the agent to the relevant `rules/*.md` file — they're self-contained review criteria |

> The `rules/*.md` files are the core value — they contain all the review criteria and work with any LLM. The `skills/*/SKILL.md` files add agent-specific automation (diff collection, file scanning, output formatting, MCP orchestration).

<details>
<summary><strong>Cherry-pick what you need</strong></summary>

## CI Setup

1. Copy `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` into your repo
2. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your repo secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions)
3. Comment one of these on any PR:

### Review Commands

| Trigger | Review Type |
|:--------|:------------|
| `/cr-react` | React/Next.js code review |
| `/cr-node` | Node.js code review |
| `/cr-python` | Python code review |
| `/cr-general` | Language-agnostic code review |
| `/cr-deps` | Dependency health audit |
| `/cr-fullstack` | Fullstack auto-detect + cross-layer |

> `cra-*` skills (full audits) are local-only and not triggered in CI.

### Autofix Commands

After a review posts findings, reply to apply fixes:

| Command | What it does | Reply to |
|:--------|:-------------|:---------|
| `/fix` | Apply the fix for a single finding | An individual finding comment |
| `/fix-all` | Apply all suggested fixes at once | The main review summary comment |

The autofix job checks out the PR branch, applies the fix(es), commits, and pushes automatically.

### How it works

The workflow:
- Detects the trigger keyword and selects the appropriate review criteria
- Only runs for repo collaborators (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR)
- Posts a summary comment with all findings, each linking to `/fix`
- Posts individual finding replies with full details and suggested code changes
- `/fix` and `/fix-all` replies trigger a separate job that applies fixes and pushes

<details>
<summary><strong>Optional: Auto-trigger on PR</strong></summary>

<br />

Uncomment the `pull_request` trigger in the workflow:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
```

</details>

<br />

---

## Security

- Trigger restricted to repo OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR only
- Autofix only applies changes suggested in review findings — no arbitrary modifications
- Fix job requires explicit `/fix` or `/fix-all` reply from an authorized collaborator
- All commits are attributed to `github-actions[bot]`

## Customization

Edit the criteria files in `rules/` to add/remove review passes, adjust confidence thresholds, change severity levels, or add framework-specific checks.

| File | Controls |
|:-----|:---------|
| `rules/react.md` | React/Next.js review rules |
| `rules/node.md` | Node.js review rules |
| `rules/python.md` | Python review rules |
| `rules/general.md` | Language-agnostic review rules |
| `rules/deps.md` | Dependency audit rules |
| `rules/fullstack.md` | Cross-layer check rules |
| `rules/autofix.md` | Autofix workflow (local + CI) |

All review skills reference these files — single source of truth per concern.

Implementation skills like `figma-to-code` are self-contained in their `SKILL.md` — no separate rules file needed.
